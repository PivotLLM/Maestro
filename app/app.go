// Package app holds the application's identity — its name, tagline, copyright
// and version — and is the only place any of them is defined.
//
// Everything here is unexported and reached through an accessor. That is a
// deliberate reversal of the usual "export the constant" habit: an exported
// constant sitting beside an accessor gives two ways to read one value, and call
// sites will use both. That is not hypothetical — it produced a binary that
// rendered its own version two different ways depending on which symbol each
// site reached for.
//
// Build metadata is injected at link time. The version itself never is: it is a
// property of the source, not of the machine that compiled it, so it stays a
// const the linker cannot reach. Deriving a version from `git describe` produces
// a binary that disagrees with its own source.

// Version returns the build's full identity: the release number, the build
// commit as SemVer build metadata, and the build number in brackets —
// "0.1.0+1a2b3c4d [20260902155301]" — degrading to "0.1.0+1a2b3c4d" or bare
// "0.1.0" as those are stamped in.
//
// This is the form for anywhere a human or a model reads it: startup banner,
// version command, logs, diagnostics.
//
// The release and the commit are one unbroken token on purpose. Rendered as
// "0.1.0 (git: 1a2b3c4d)" it gets copied into a bug report as "0.1.0" — the
// space reads as the end of the value — so the half that identifies the exact
// source is the half that gets dropped. The build number is deliberately on the
// far side of the space: truncating there still leaves the commit attached, and
// the number answers a different question anyway (see Build).
//
// The separator is "+", not "-", because SemVer gives the two different
// meanings. "+" introduces build metadata, which the spec requires be IGNORED
// when comparing versions, so "0.1.0+1a2b3c4d" compares equal to "0.1.0" — it is
// that release, built from that commit. "-" would introduce a PRE-RELEASE
// identifier, making it compare LOWER than "0.1.0" and claiming to be something
// that came before the release rather than an instance of it.

// which is the commit's job — but ordering is the whole point: 20260902155301
// is plainly later than 20260902094117.
//
// A timestamp rather than a counter because a counter needs stored state, and a
// commit count does not move when the same commit is rebuilt — exactly the case
// worth catching while iterating against a running install. Seconds rather than
// minutes because two rebuilds inside one minute is ordinary. UTC because local

// and cannot take the 14-digit stamp — that value does not fit in a 32-bit int.
// The day is eight digits and is safely below math.MaxInt32 on every platform
